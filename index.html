    <!-- third question -->
    <h3 class="main-purpose2">Why did we set up the team? </h3>

    <p class="some_info_about_Team">
        Participating in competitions is the best way to make us grow adn apply what we learn
        <br>
        The goal of the team is to create an environment conducive to to creativity and practicality.
        <br>
        <br>
        And this is why our mission became the transfer of knowledge and experience from generation to generation,
        <br>
        which is prompted us to open a branch in the team for school students to participate with us in the competition.
